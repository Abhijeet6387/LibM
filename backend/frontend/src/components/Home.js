        <h4>What is a Library Management System ?</h4>
        <section>
          A Library Management System is a software built to handle the primary
          housekeeping functions of a library. Libraries rely on library
          management systems to manage asset collections as well as
          relationships with their members. Library management systems help
          libraries keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well as
          membersâ€™ subscriptions and profiles. Library management systems also
          involve maintaining the database for entering new books and recording
          books that have been borrowed with their respective due dates.
